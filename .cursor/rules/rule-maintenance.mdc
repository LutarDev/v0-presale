- Are there breaking changes?
- Do examples need updates?
- Are new patterns introduced?

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Impact on development workflow
- Consistency with existing patterns
- Clarity and completeness
- Alignment with project goals

### 3. Update Phase
**Update Process:**
1. Create a branch for rule updates
2. Update affected rule files
3. Verify all examples and code snippets
4. Test updated patterns in development
5. Review changes with team
6. Merge and communicate changes

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] All code examples are tested and working
- [ ] Documentation is clear and comprehensive
- [ ] Links and references are valid
- [ ] Formatting and structure are consistent
- [ ] Changes are backwards compatible where possible

### 4. Communication Phase
**Communication Methods:**
- Team notifications for rule updates
- Documentation changelog
- Code review comments referencing updates
- Training sessions for major changes

**Communication Timeline:**
- Immediate: Critical security or breaking changes
- Weekly: Regular updates and improvements
- Monthly: Comprehensive rule reviews
- Quarterly: Major architectural changes

## Rule Effectiveness Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- **Rule Adherence**: How often patterns are followed correctly
- **Development Speed**: Impact on development velocity
- **Code Quality**: Reduction in bugs and inconsistencies
- **Onboarding Time**: New developer ramp-up speed
- **Documentation Usage**: Which rules are most referenced

### Monitoring Tools
- Code review feedback
- Automated linting and pattern detection
- Developer surveys and feedback

## Best Practices for Rule Maintenance

### Writing Effective Rules
1. **Be Specific**: Provide concrete examples and patterns
2. **Explain Why**: Include rationale for rules
3. **Keep Current**: Regular updates and maintenance
4. **Test Examples**: All code examples should be tested
5. **Consider Impact**: Think about developer experience

### Managing Rule Complexity
- Break complex rules into smaller, focused rules
- Use cross-references between related rules
- Maintain a clear hierarchy of rule importance
- Regular cleanup of outdated or redundant rules

### Ensuring Rule Adoption
- Make rules easily discoverable
- Integrate rules into development workflow
- Provide tooling to support rule compliance
- Regular training and communication
- Lead by example in code reviews

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Rule Updates
**Scenarios Requiring Emergency Updates:**
- Security vulnerabilities in documented patterns
- Breaking changes in external dependencies
- Critical bugs in recommended approaches
- Compliance or legal requirement changes

**Emergency Process:**
1. Immediate notification to all team members
2. Rapid assessment of impact and required changes
3. Emergency rule update with clear change markers
4. Follow-up communication with detailed explanation
5. Post-emergency review and process improvement

### Rollback Procedures
